# Perceptron From Scratch! with Iris Dataset

This Streamlit app demonstrates a simple implementation of a perceptron classifier from scratch using the Iris dataset. It allows users to adjust the model parameters (number of epochs and learning rate) and visualize the error over epochs as well as the decision boundary.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib pandas
